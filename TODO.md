Maybe some improvements someday:

* Render man page to markdown so it can be read on github.

* Record exit status in log filename

* Send mail about locked state directory after N tries instead of every time.

* Send locked state directory messages to -T address instead of default crontab owner.

* "Executable configuration file" instead of wrappers.

* Ability to send signal to process group instead of just the child process.

* Ability to send followup signal if child doesn't go away.

* [roundup](http://bmizerany.github.io/roundup/) tests
